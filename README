Probabilistic Selection Task.  Unpublished!   Same sample as this published study: 10.1038/ncomms6394.  Study 1: 80 healthy participants + 5 placebo session from a pilot of the drug study.  Total n=85.   But Subj 173 might have bad EEG.   Study 2: 30 healthy participants (3 dropout) in a double-blind drug study.    Total n=27.   Drug was Cabergoline 1.25 mg.   Study 1 subjects had IDs 101-180 and the 5 placebo were 301/401 - 305/405.   Study 2 subjects had IDs 305/405 - 330/430.   The dual numbers were for session:  300s were first session, 400s were second session.  Here we have simply put them in as session 1 and session 2.   So Joe Smith would have been 305 on visit 1, then 405 on visit 2. [shrug - old days before BIDS formatting led to complex labeling]. If he got cab first we indicated that in the Sess1_Drug column.   Task included in Matlab programming language.   Data collected circa 2012-2013 in Laboratory for Neural Computation & Cognition at Brown.  Check the .xls sheet under code folder for more meta data.   A few old analysis scripts are included.  - James F Cavanagh 02/15/2021
